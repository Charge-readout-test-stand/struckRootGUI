Some notes:

On the SIS3316-DT device (and in the ROOT GUI software), channels are labelled
1 to 16. In the code, channels are 0 to 15. 

The makefile doesn't work correctly on my Mac. Everytime I change a file, I need
to make clean, then make. 

I have only tested things in the Release directory, and not the Debug one.
