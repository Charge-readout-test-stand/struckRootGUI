# struckRootGUI

software packages:
* rootGUI -- program that runs on the DAQ to collect tier0 data from SIS3316
* sis3316_offline -- old code to convert tier0 to tier1
* sis3316_offline_new -- new code to convert tier0 to tier1, for use when we
  trigger externally with PMT (this is the most common mode of data taking)
* sis3316_offline_single_tree -- new code to convert tier0 to tier1, for when we
  trigger each channel independently (this is unusual)
